# Arithmetic Progression (AP) and Sum of Arithmetic Progression (AP) Cheatsheet

## Arithmetic Progression (AP)

An **Arithmetic Progression** is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the **common difference** and is usually denoted by **`d`**.

### General Form of an AP
If the first term of an AP is `a` and the common difference is `d`, then the terms of the AP are:
\[
a, \; a + d, \; a + 2d, \; a + 3d, \; \ldots
\]

### \( n \)-th Term of an AP
The \( n \)-th term (or general term) of an AP can be found using:
\[
\text{nth term } (a_n) = a + (n - 1)d
\]
where:
- `a` = first term,
- `d` = common difference,
- `n` = term position in the sequence.

## Sum of First \( n \) Terms of an AP

The sum of the first \( n \) terms (denoted `S_n`) of an AP is given by:
\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (2a + (n - 1)d)
\]

Or, if you know the first term (`a`) and the last term (`l`), you can also use:
\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a + l)
\]

where:
- `S_n` = sum of the first `n` terms,
- `a` = first term,
- `d` = common difference,
- `n` = number of terms,
- `l` = last term.
