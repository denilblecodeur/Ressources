On Manhattan:
UVa 10319 - Manhattan * (the hard part in solving problems involving 2- SAT is in identifying that it is indeed a 2-SAT problem and then building the implication graph; for this problem, we set each street and each avenue as a variable where true means that it can only be used in a certain direction and false means that it can only be used in the other direction; a simple path will be in one of this form: (street a ∧ avenue b) ∨ (avenue c ∧ street d); this can be transformed into 2-CNF formula of (a∨c)∧(a∨d)∧(b∨c)∧(b∨d); build the implication graph and check if it is satisfiable using the SCC check as shown above; note that there exists a special case where the clause only has one literal, i.e. the simple path uses one street only or one avenue only.)
